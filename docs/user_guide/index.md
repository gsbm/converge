## When to use Converge

Converge is **ideal for**: embeddable agent substrate, research, automation, LLM-backed workflows, and federated or edge deployments where you want identity, messaging, discovery, and task coordination without a central controller. It is **less ideal for**: fully managed agent SaaS or heavy UI out of the box. Those scenarios typically need additional gateway, API, and UI layers. See [Customization](customization.md) and [Extensions](extensions.md) to adapt the runtime, transport, and policy to your use case.
